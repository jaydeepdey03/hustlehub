### Why I decided to make this project

I decided to create this project because I'm passionate about entrepreneurship and wanted to support other entrepreneurs like myself. I noticed that there weren't many good platforms out there specifically for startups, so I saw a chance to step in and fill that gap. I've personally faced challenges when starting my own business, and I wanted to make it easier for others to find team members, access resources, and connect with mentors. My main goal is to create a welcoming community where entrepreneurs can thrive and make a positive impact on the world.

### Tech Stack I have used

* React + Typescript + Vite
    
* For UI: Chakra UI (Typescript)
    
* Backend: Appwrite Cloud ([https://cloud.appwrite.io/](https://cloud.appwrite.io/))
    
    * Database API
        
    * Accounts API
        
    * Storage API

#### How each Appwrite cloud feature helped me

#### Accounts API, Database API, and Storage API offered by Appwrite were instrumental in supporting my project.

* #### The Accounts API enabled smooth user authentication and profile management, allowing users to sign up and login securely.
    

* #### With the Database API, I could easily store and retrieve structured data for user-generated content, startup information, and milestones, ensuring efficient organization and retrieval of data.
    
* #### The Storage API simplified file uploads, storage, and retrieval, allowing seamless handling of images, documents, and media files associated with user and startup profiles. These APIs collectively simplified backend development, enabling me to focus on building core features and delivering a user-friendly experience to my app users.
    

### How Appwrite helped me?

* Appwrite played a crucial role in developing this app and making it a success. It provided a wide range of powerful backend services that saved us a ton of time and effort.
    
* With Appwrite, we were able to easily handle user authentication, manage user profiles, and securely store and retrieve data.
    

Its seamless integration with various databases and storage providers gave us the flexibility to scale our app as needed. Appwrite also offered comprehensive documentation and support, making the development process smooth and efficient.

### Challenges I Faced

* During the development of the app, I encountered challenges related to certain services in Appwrite, especially because it was still in the beta stage. Two crucial functionalities that posed difficulties were database relationship management and image mapping.
    
* Managing database relationships within Appwrite required extra effort due to limited documentation and fewer available resources. Understanding the best practices and implementing complex relationships between collections and documents was a time-consuming task. I had to experiment and iterate to find the most effective approach.
    
* Similarly, handling image mapping and manipulation in Appwrite presented challenges. The image service lacked comprehensive documentation, making it harder to grasp the available features and their implementation. Mapping images to the appropriate data models and performing necessary transformations demanded additional research and trial and error.
    
* Despite these challenges, I persevered by leveraging community forums, engaging in discussions, and exploring alternative approaches. Through continuous learning and experimentation, I was able to overcome these hurdles and successfully integrate the required functionalities into the app.
    

### Demo of the app and its working

* Users can create their startup profiles, providing details about their business idea, goals, and team members.
    
* Startups can add milestones to track their progress, mark achievements, and showcase their growth to potential investors and collaborators.
    
* The app provides a platform for startups to connect with investors and seek funding for their ventures. Startups can create funding proposals and investors can browse and evaluate investment opportunities.
    
* Users can browse and discover startups based on various criteria such as industry, location, or funding status. They can explore detailed profiles, including milestones, team information, and funding progress.
    
* Individuals who are interested in a startup can join their journey, becoming part of the team or offering their expertise as advisors or mentors.
    
* Users can create hackathons within the app, specifying the theme, duration, and goals of the event.
    
* Other users can join the hackathons, either as individuals or as part of a team. They can collaborate with team members, brainstorm ideas, and work on projects during the hackathon.
    
* The app provides communication tools and project management features to facilitate collaboration and ensure smooth progress during the hackathon.
    
* Participants can present their ideas or prototypes at the end of the hackathon, gaining exposure and potential recognition for their work.
    
* The app fosters a supportive community where users can provide feedback, share knowledge, and offer resources to support each other's entrepreneurial endeavours.
